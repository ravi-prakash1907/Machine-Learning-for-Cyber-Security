## Problem Statement   

Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have a presence across all urban, 
semi-urban and rural areas. A customer first applies for a home loan, after that the company 
validates the customer’s eligibility for a loan.  

Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real-time) based on customer details 
provided while filling an online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, 
Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. 
To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers’ segments, 
those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers.  
[Here](./datasets) they have provided a partial data set 
(we have also kept the final prediction in the same directory).
