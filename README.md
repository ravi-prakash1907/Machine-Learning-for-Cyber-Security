# Machine Learning for Cyber Security
To store own ML projects of CySec domain  

Few good research works are:  
1. [Feature Selection based Classification of Spams Using Fuzzy Support Vector Machine](https://sci-hub.se/10.1109/ICOSEC49089.2020.9215443)
2. [Filtering spam messages and mails using fuzzy C means algorithm](10.1109/IoT-SIU.2019.8777483)
3. [Evolving Fuzzy Set-based and Cloud-based Unsupervised Classifiers for Spam Detection](10.1109/TLA.2019.8931138)
